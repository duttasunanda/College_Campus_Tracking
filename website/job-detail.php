                                 * Bachelor's Degree (B.E./B.Tech.):<br>
                                   * This is the fundamental requirement for most engineering campus placements. Companies primarily recruit students who are in the final year of their B.E./B.Tech. programs.<br>
                                   * The specific engineering discipline (e.g., Computer Science, Mechanical, Electrical) must align with the company's needs.<br>
                                 * Academic Records:<br>
                                   * While not a "degree" itself, consistent academic performance is crucial. Employers examine:<br>

                                     * Lack of backlogs: Companies generally prefer students with a clean academic record.<br>
                                Degrees that can be beneficial:<br>
                                 * Master's Degree (M.E./M.Tech.):<br>
                                   * For specialized roles or research-oriented positions, an M.E./M.Tech. degree can be a significant advantage.<br>
                                   * It demonstrates advanced knowledge and expertise in a specific engineering field.<br>

                                   * While not a degree, certifications in specific software, programming languages, or technical skills can enhance a student's profile.<br>
                                Key Considerations:<br>
                                 * Focus on the Bachelor's Degree: The vast majority of on-campus recruitment targets B.E./B.Tech. students.<br>
                                 * Beyond the Degree:<br>
                                   * Employers place significant emphasis on practical skills, project experience, internships, and soft skills, in addition to the degree itself.<br>
                                   * Therefore, while having the correct degree is essential, it is not the only factor that is considered.<br>
                                 * It is important to remember that the requirements will vary from company to company.<br>
                                In essence, a B.E./B.Tech. degree is the primary qualification, but a strong academic record and a well-rounded skill set are equally important.</p>

                                 * Master's Degree (M.E./M.Tech.):<br>
                                   * For specialized roles or research-oriented positions, an M.E./M.Tech. degree can be a significant advantage.<br>
                                   * It demonstrates advanced knowledge and expertise in a specific engineering field.<br>
                                 * Relevant Certifications:<br>
                                   * While not a degree, certifications in specific software, programming languages, or technical skills can enhance a student's profile.<br>
                                Key Considerations:<br>
                                 * Focus on the Bachelor's Degree: The vast majority of on-campus recruitment targets B.E./B.Tech. students.<br>
                                 * Beyond the Degree:<br>
                                   * Employers place significant emphasis on practical skills, project experience, internships, and soft skills, in addition to the degree itself.<br>
                                   * Therefore, while having the correct degree is essential, it is not the only factor that is considered.<br>
                                 * It is important to remember that the requirements will vary from company to company.<br>
                                In essence, a B.E./B.Tech. degree is the primary qualification, but a strong academic record and a well-rounded skill set are equally important.</p>
